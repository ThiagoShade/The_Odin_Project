        <a>This is an anchor without a link, it doesn't do nothing</a>
        <br>
        <br>
        <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">
            This is an anchor with a hypertext reference (href) attribute containing the target link
        </a>
        <br>
        <br>
        <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            This is the same anchor as before but with the attribute target with the value _blank, 
            which opens the link in a new tab. Also has the rel attribute with the values noopener noreferrer, 
            which is a security measure to prevent the new tab from accessing the original tab (noopener) and
            prevent the new tab from knowing the source page that has the link to it
        </a>
        <br>
        <br>
        <a href="links_images2.html">
            The href attribute of this anchor has a relative link to another HTML page
            in the same folder
        </a>
        <br>
        <br>
        <a href="./pages/links_images3.html">
            The href attribute of this anchor has a relative link to another HTML page

            Below is an img tag with the src attribute containing the relative link
            to an image in the same folder.
            It also has an alt attribute with a text that will be displayed if the image
            doesn't load, it is also used by screen readers to describe the image to visually
            impaired people.
